This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`npx create-next-app@latest --ts`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app).

## About

Create a basic Next.js starter project as our project template

## Features

**Next.js with TypeScript**

- Because I love strongly typed languages, OOP, and TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. 

**Lint & format**

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/): Find and fix problems in your JavaScript & TypeScript code.
- [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-vscode) : code formatter.
- [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky): Pre-commit hook included to lint your staged files.
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/): a JavaScript compiler. Because [Next.js includes the `next/babel`](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/customizing-babel-config), we just config it.

- Debugging with Chrome DevTools :
